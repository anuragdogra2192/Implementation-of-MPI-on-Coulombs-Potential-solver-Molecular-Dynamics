# MPI implementaion on Coulumbs Potential
In molecular dynamics (MD) there is a pairwise interaction between N set of particles.This code is to implement the Coulomb Solver.The simple_sequential.cpp is the sequential code of Coulomb Solver without MPI(Message Passing Interface).
MPI_potential.cpp is the MPI implementation on the simple sequential code.

The input file : There are two entities charge q<sub>i <sub> of a particle and
